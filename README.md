# DatabaseApplication
This project allows the user to do the following: add a movie, remove a movie, and list all movies' records. It also allows the user to change a movie record (e.g. to allow a user to change the movie and/or to change the position) Users can query the data in at least three different ways: Or, AND, ORDER, and LIKE. All the queries in this project provide meaningful information in the movie domain.
